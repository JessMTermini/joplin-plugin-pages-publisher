# How to use Git manually to push

If you have generated your site, but for some reasons, fail to publish it, and/or you hope to use git manually to push it to Github, you can follow following steps:

**Step 1**: `cd <output-dir>`（you can get `<output-dir>` in "Generated Successfully" modal）
**Step 2**: `git init --separate-git-dir ../git_repository`

Since now, you can use git as usual to do anything you want, including pushing to remote.
